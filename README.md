# Secure Coding Review

This project focused on performing a **Secure Coding Review** to evaluate source code for potential vulnerabilities and recommend best practices to enhance application security. The main objective was to identify risks, mitigate threats, and promote secure software development practices.

### Key Highlights
- **Comprehensive Code Analysis** – Conducted a detailed examination of source code to uncover common security weaknesses.  
- **Threat Identification** – Detected vulnerabilities including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and insecure authentication flows.  
- **Actionable Security Recommendations** – Provided clear guidance and best practices to strengthen application security.  
- **Effective Tool Usage** – Leveraged both automated static code analyzers and manual inspection techniques for thorough coverage.  

### Skills Developed
- **Secure Coding Practices** – Applied techniques to improve software security at the development stage.  
- **Vulnerability Assessment** – Gained hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating security risks.  
- **Code Review Expertise** – Enhanced proficiency in both manual and automated code review processes.  
- **Cybersecurity Awareness** – Strengthened understanding of principles for developing secure and resilient applications.  

### Conclusion
The Secure Coding Review project enhanced my ability to detect and remediate application vulnerabilities. It emphasized the importance of proactive code assessment and adherence to secure development practices to build safe, reliable software.
